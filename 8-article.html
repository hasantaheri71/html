    Definition and Usage
    The
    <article> tag specifies independent, self-contained content.

        An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest
        of the site.

        Potential sources for the
        <article> element:

            Forum post
            Blog post
            News story
            Comment
